The first assignment for APCSP

Why you should study Computer Science is because it will make you use critical thinking and logical skills and those are good skills which you will need to use in the future. Computing is now being introduced into many jobs and is a big requirement for those companies. It also offers many opportunities for creativity in which people can show off to the world on what they have to offer. In computing, you will have to do tasks individually and also could have to work with a team and you could use those collaborative skills. And now, computers are everywhere and are a part of everthing we do.
